# GitHub Repository Analysis Tool - Development Backlog Structure

## Backlog Organization

The development backlog will be organized using the following structure:

### 1. Epics
High-level features or capabilities that span multiple sprints and contain multiple user stories.

### 2. User Stories
Specific functionality described from the user's perspective, following the format:
"As a [user role], I want [feature/capability] so that [benefit/value]."

### 3. Tasks
Concrete development activities required to implement a user story.

### 4. Acceptance Criteria
Specific conditions that must be met for a user story to be considered complete.

## Priority Levels

Each backlog item will be assigned one of the following priority levels:

- **Critical**: Must be completed for minimum viable product (MVP)
- **High**: Important for core functionality but not blocking MVP
- **Medium**: Valuable features that enhance the product
- **Low**: Nice-to-have features that can be deferred

## Effort Estimation

Effort will be estimated using story points on the Fibonacci scale:
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21

## Sprint Planning

The backlog will be organized into sprints based on the implementation timeline:
- Sprint duration: 2 weeks
- Phase 1 (P0): Sprints 1-4
- Phase 2 (P1): Sprints 5-9
- Phase 3 (P2): Sprints 10-15

## Dependencies

Dependencies between backlog items will be explicitly documented to ensure proper sequencing of development tasks.

## Milestones

Key milestones will be defined to mark significant achievements in the development process, aligned with the phases outlined in the PRD.
