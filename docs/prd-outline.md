## Document Information
- **Project Name**: GitHub Repository Analysis Tool
- **Version**: 1.0
- **Date**: April 2, 2025
- **Status**: Draft

## Executive Summary
This document outlines the requirements for enhancing the GitHub Repository Analysis Tool, a web application that helps users manage, analyze, and gain insights from their GitHub repositories. The enhancements will focus on improving the user interface, adding new features, and integrating advanced code analysis capabilities.

## Product Vision
